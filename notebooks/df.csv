The Spring Ball is approaching extremely fast. Now it is time to open some secrets to you!😎

🔹 This year, you do not need to go to several obligatory rehearsals to participate in the ball. Instead, all of you are welcome to a masterclass a day before the ball. Even if you cannot attend this one, we will have some learning at the start of the event.

🔸Don't worry if you do not have a partner for now. During the ball, you will be able to find and swap pairs. Thus, this meeting will allow you to meet new friends, discover something from each other and, probably, find your second half ❤️

🔹Finally, we'll have dancing games at the Spring Ball. They will make you smile and will motivate you to find a new partner. New experiences and emotions are guaranteed. Come to the ball and try these games!","['Dance', 'Master Class']"

Register by September 27th: 

We invite Frontend and Backend developers; analysts, Product managers, designers, testers, students and graduates of technical universities.

The organizer of the hackathon is the insurance company ""Consent"". The company has been on the market for more than 30 years and is one of the top 10 insurers in Russia.

🚀 Hackathon participants can choose from one of the tasks based on real business cases of Soglasie Insurance Company:

1️⃣ A web service for testing hypotheses. In a saturated insurance market, companies are constantly looking for new ways to attract customers. This requires rapid testing of various hypotheses and ideas. Your task in this track is to develop a web service that will allow you to create and test new insurance products. This service should help companies quickly test the effectiveness of various hypotheses by creating digital insurance products with minimal time and resources.

2️⃣ A service for project management. In a large company with many projects, information about them is often scattered across various systems and formats. This leads to difficulties in management, lack of transparency and loss of time to search for relevant data. Your task in this track is to develop a web service for centralized storage, convenient display and monitoring of large projects within the company.

What awaits the participants at the hackathon?
🔸 Solving a real business problem from a large insurance company
🔸 Communicating with experts and getting feedback
🔸 Meetups, check points, final presentation and award ceremony

Fyodor Sergeevich Stonyakin - Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Senior Researcher at the Laboratory of Advanced Combinatorics and Network Applications of MIPT, Head of the Department of Algebra and Functional Analysis at the Physical-Technical Institute of the Crimean Federal University named after V.I. Vernadsky.

The lecture will cover the following topics: Optimization problems, involving finding maxima or minima, are frequently encountered and are introduced as early as school, during the study of derivatives. However, the apparatus of derivatives (or gradients, in the case of multivariable functions) is not suitable for all optimization problems. For example, the objective function for finding the minimal radius sphere covering a given set of points is non-differentiable at an infinite number of points.

In this lecture, we will review examples of well-known nonsmooth optimization problems related to data analysis (such as LASSO regression and the problem of recovering a low-rank matrix with a non-Euclidean quality metric). These approaches can be useful in combating overfitting and addressing the instability of the standard least squares method in the presence of data anomalies or outliers. We will discuss key concepts from subgradient theory and numerical methods for solving nonsmooth optimization problems, highlighting some of their fundamental characteristics. In conclusion, we will briefly touch upon some contemporary works in this field and suggest topics for possible collaborative research (including course and thesis projects).

I would like to invite you to my farewell party as I prepare to step down from my position as the Head of the Students affairs and alumni centre. 
Working at the university has been an incredible journey, especially because of the privilege of collaborating with the students. You have been my greatest source of inspiration, driving me to create new projects that were meant for your growth and success.  

Together, we have achieved so much — from Innobootcamps to the creation and launch of new programs like the Tutorship Program, from exciting new events to talent scouting. We also tackled numerous challenges, and in my opinion, we always overcame them as a united team.  

Thank you for everything! I wish you all continued success and a deep love for this university.

This approach is motivated by objective functions arising in neural network training tasks and reflects the correlation between the growth of the Hessian matrix norms and the local smoothness constant.

The lesson aims to raise students’ awareness of the cultural norms and values embedded in English expressions of politeness, such as indirect requests, hedging, and modal verbs, as well as the problem of ambiguity of English politeness. Through interactive activities, i.e., analysis of authentic dialogues in film, role-plays, and comparison of politeness strategies in English with those in their native languages, students will foster a deeper understanding of how language reflects cultural expectations. By the end of the lesson, students will be better equipped to navigate diverse communicative contexts with sensitivity and appropriateness, enhancing both their linguistic competence and intercultural awareness.

A good product matters. But what investors care about early on is this:
🔹 What you’ve already tested in the market,
🔹 Who you’ve pitched to,
🔹 And what came of it.

When a team dives headfirst into product development and forgets to showcase:
🔸 Their real-world experiments,
🔸 Customer interactions, or
🔸 Iterations based on feedback...
...investors simply can’t see that the startup is alive and hunting for demand.

We’ll discuss:
✔️ What ""traction indicators"" are and why they matter
✔️ Why ""being too polished"" is also a mistake
✔️ How investors gauge progress before profit and growth
